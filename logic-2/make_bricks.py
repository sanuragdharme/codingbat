# We want to make a row of bricks that is goal inches long. We have a number of small bricks (1 inch each) and big
# bricks (5 inches each). Return True if it is possible to make the goal by choosing from the given bricks. This is a
# little harder than it looks and can be done without any loops.

# make_bricks(3, 1, 8) → True
# make_bricks(3, 1, 9) → False
# make_bricks(3, 2, 10) → True
